Dewalt 611 Deflector and Dust Shoe
The Dewalt 611 is a great router to use as the spindle for CNC machines, but it does have one drawback: the motor is air cooled, and this air is vented out the bottom of the motor housing.  This blows all the chips and dust into the environment, making everything a big mess.  I've designed this plate to screw into the bottom of the router, deflecting the air upwards and away from the spindle.  I've also added an optional mounting for a vacuum hose with a footprint that can accommodate a removable, magnetized dust shoe.  

You can either print just the deflector plate, or you can print the deflector plate with the vacuum coupling and the dust shoe.  

You can customize the SCAD code to tweak the model to your needs.  The SCAD is somewhat difficult to manipulate because it is generated by Python code.  The Python code can be found at my [GitHub repository](https://github.com/vishnubob/dw611).
